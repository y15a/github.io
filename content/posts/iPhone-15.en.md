USB-C. It's about time, but for models with A16, it's still running USB 2.0. Probably due to the lack of USB 3.0 controller in the chipset. Not that anyone would be troubled by the sub-GB/s bandwidth in this wireless age, but for an industry flagship product to have technology THIS old is kind of comical.

With the weaker Yen, the new iPhone 15 Pro base model costs about the same as a month's rent for my house. It accommodates a family of four, and a dog, comes with a parking space, located in a town that's 30 minutes away from Tokyo by train.

We've come a long way from the days of Nokia and Motorola.
