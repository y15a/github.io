Joyz, Inc. (Head office: Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, Japan; CEO: Yoshiyuki Kakihara; hereinafter referred to as Joyz) announces that it has started joint research with the Saruwatari-Koyama Laboratory, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, on the application of speech synthesis technology to language acquisition. In this joint research, Joyz will work with Assistant Professor Shinnosuke Takamichi (hereafter, Assistant Professor Takamichi) in Saruwatari Laboratory, Department of Systems Information Science, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, to develop effective foreign language acquisition methods utilising learning history and speech data owned by Joyz, in an industry-academia collaboration system.


I visited the University of Tokyo to discuss the research theme. I was impressed with how quickly Professor Takamichi grasped what we wanted to do. I can't wait to see the outcome.
