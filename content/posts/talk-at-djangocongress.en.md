I gave a talk at [DjangoCongress JP 2018](https://djangocongress.jp/2018) named "Django in the age of AI - the Good, the Bad and the Ugly".

I have been somewhat distant from the local Python community since I helped run PyCon JP 2014 as a publicity team member. I hope my talk was interesting enough.
