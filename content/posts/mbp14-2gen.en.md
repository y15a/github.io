I've been with it for over a month now. This is easily the best computer I've ever owned.

I don't have to go over the performance and battery life offered by Apple Silicon, as its superiority is apparent in spec sheets and rave reviews. Still, this thing handles pretty much everything I throw at it.

As a technical startup CEO, I split my time between People, Capital, Product and Administration. MacBook Pro will keep up with it for an entire day. Video conferencing for hours? No problem. Opening a large spreadsheet for financial modelling? Easy. Running virtualised Linux servers through Docker for Mac? It's faster than running it bare metal on an Intel laptop.

The keyboard is excellent, too. I'm one of the few people who actually liked the butterfly keyboard. It was great to type on my MacBook 2016 - the 12-inch model. It was thin, with little travel, but I could type faster on that machine than anything else. I'm still waiting for a revival of that model, although I would do much better with a laptop with a fan, considering my current workload.

I don't even have to talk about the trackpad and the display. You know it's best-in-class. As for the operating system, it's one of the most stable and fuss-free environments available. As a busy professional, you just want to get things done. And to get things done, your laptop needs to, just, work.
