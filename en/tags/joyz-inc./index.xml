In this article, I’m hoping to provide extra context around our decision to become an office-less organisation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Joyz Inc. has implemented an office-less management system that embraces the distributed/work-from-home style of work company-wide.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-2020-pandemic-started-it-all">The 2020 pandemic started it all&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For Joyz, like many other companies, the direct impetus for moving to office-less management was the outbreak of the COVID-19.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My first 50 days of being the lead software engineer (again)</title><link>https://www.y15a.com/en/posts/first-50-days-of-being-a-lead-again/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 06:56:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.y15a.com/en/posts/first-50-days-of-being-a-lead-again/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recent departures at our company led to a lack of technical leadership, especially in the infra/backend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had two choices. One is to scramble to hire a tech lead. Two is for me to assume the role temporarily while simultaneously functioning as the CEO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went for the second option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This may seem like a red flag to some people. It is not ideal. Equally, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready to throw someone into a job where they faced technical obstacles while understanding the users, the team, and the codebase. I was not confident enough to complete the hire in a month.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning as a function of experience, talent and dream</title><link>https://www.y15a.com/en/posts/learning-as-a-function/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 22:03:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.y15a.com/en/posts/learning-as-a-function/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.joyz.co.jp/">an EdTech company&lt;/a> and a father of two toddlers, I’ve put a lot of thought into what makes people learn new things and develop to be the person they aspire to be. This isn’t limited to learning that typically happens in schools. Personal growth and development are fundamental requirements for a thriving organisation.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve come to observe in my professional career that the amount of learning one makes out of a particular experience differs greatly by person. In sports, for example, the same amount of training can yield drastically different skill levels, depending on what people typically call ‘a knack’ or ‘a talent’. The same phenomenon can be observed in virtually anything. Great programmers acquire new concepts quickly and apply them to their work right away. Great marketers generate customer insight like no one else. Sometimes you’re left in awe of how easily mathematicians spot patterns in a seemingly unrelated set of observations. The list goes on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interview by AI Pro Blog</title><link>https://www.y15a.com/en/posts/aiproblog-joyz/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2019 12:32:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.y15a.com/en/posts/aiproblog-joyz/</guid><description>&lt;p>Nicely covered.
