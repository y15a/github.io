As such, I have a wide range of apps installed for business administration, software development, design, photography, and everything in between. Here’s a list of the apps I use heavily, regardless of the project I’m working on at the moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="alfred-5">Alfred 5&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred 5&lt;/a> is a powerful Spotlight replacement for Mac. It offers file search, shortcuts, dictionary, and recently, AI integration.

At the same time, I always thought their marketing and the founder’s sale pitch were a bit bizarre (sorry), potentially putting off some users who would otherwise be a great fit. So, I’m taking a shot at explaining what’s revolutionary about the product. I’m in no way affiliated with the company. I’m paying to use the product.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning as a function of experience, talent and dream</title><link>https://www.y15a.com/en/posts/learning-as-a-function/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 22:03:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.y15a.com/en/posts/learning-as-a-function/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.joyz.co.jp/">an EdTech company&lt;/a> and a father of two toddlers, I’ve put a lot of thought into what makes people learn new things and develop to be the person they aspire to be. This isn’t limited to learning that typically happens in schools. Personal growth and development are fundamental requirements for a thriving organisation.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve come to observe in my professional career that the amount of learning one makes out of a particular experience differs greatly by person. In sports, for example, the same amount of training can yield drastically different skill levels, depending on what people typically call ‘a knack’ or ‘a talent’. The same phenomenon can be observed in virtually anything. Great programmers acquire new concepts quickly and apply them to their work right away. Great marketers generate customer insight like no one else. Sometimes you’re left in awe of how easily mathematicians spot patterns in a seemingly unrelated set of observations. The list goes on.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
