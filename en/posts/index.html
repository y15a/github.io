Joyz Inc. has implemented an office-less management system that embraces the distributed/work-from-home style of work company-wide.
The 2020 pandemic started it all For Joyz, like many other companies, the direct impetus for moving to office-less management was the outbreak of the COVID-19.

We had two choices. One is to scramble to hire a tech lead. Two is for me to assume the role temporarily while simultaneously functioning as the CEO.
We went for the second option.
This may seem like a red flag to some people. It is not ideal. Equally, I wasn’t ready to throw someone into a job where they faced technical obstacles while understanding the users, the team, and the codebase. I was not confident enough to complete the hire in a month.

It’s about time, but for models with A16, it’s still running USB 2.0. Probably due to the lack of USB 3.0 controller in the chipset.

With the weaker Yen, the new iPhone 15 Pro base model costs about the same as a month’s rent for my house. It accommodates a family of four, and a dog, comes with a parking space, located in a town that’s 30 minutes away from Tokyo by train.

I don’t have to go over the performance and battery life offered by Apple Silicon, as its superiority is apparent in spec sheets and rave reviews. Still, this thing handles pretty much everything I throw at it.
As a technical startup CEO, I split my time between People, Capital, Product and Administration. MacBook Pro will keep up with it for an entire day. Video conferencing for hours? No problem. Opening a large spreadsheet for financial modelling? Easy. Running virtualised Linux servers through Docker for Mac? It’s faster than running it bare metal on an Intel laptop.

The key here is that any government-led regional instalment of EdTech products will be a policy decision and not a purely pedagogical one.
One reason pedagogy seems very fragmented and teaching methods differ greatly from teacher to teacher is in academia’s pursuit of novelty — particularly in learning/teaching methodology. When your goal is inventing a new method that is more effective than the baseline method, your research project will need to ensure that the methodology is strictly enforced. For that, you likely need someone who’s already very invested in understanding the methodology — a colleague, or even the very author of the research project. This level of methodological enforcement is very difficult to achieve in the real world, unless you have the budget for extensive training as well as in-term audit. It is also likely that teachers participating in the study exhibit a bias in terms of their general passion in improving their teaching. Simply put, it’s all far too optimistic.

This isn’t limited to learning that typically happens in schools. Personal growth and development are fundamental requirements for a thriving organisation.
I’ve come to observe in my professional career that the amount of learning one makes out of a particular experience differs greatly by person. In sports, for example, the same amount of training can yield drastically different skill levels, depending on what people typically call ‘a knack’ or ‘a talent’. The same phenomenon can be observed in virtually anything. Great programmers acquire new concepts quickly and apply them to their work right away. Great marketers generate customer insight like no one else. Sometimes you’re left in awe of how easily mathematicians spot patterns in a seemingly unrelated set of observations. The list goes on.
